========================

This is a 3D printed case for the Kyria, compatible with revision 0.7 and up.

To make a case, you'll need to print:

- left_case.stl
- right_case.stl or kyria_logo_right_case.stl

Furthermore, you'll need:

- 14 of M2 x 10mm machine screws
- 14 of M2 tapered heat-set inserts *(the ones used in the above photo are [Link](https://www.mcmaster.com/94180A312))*

This case is designed to work with the same sized plate as the one in the "Plate Case". A STL to 3D print a plate is provided in the case files, but a laser cut metal or acryllic plate can also be used.
